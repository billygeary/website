I am an applied, quantitative ecologist with experience in a broad range of disciplines including ecosystem management, decision science, spatial conservation planning and conservation biology. 

I am currently a PhD Student in the Centre for Integrative Ecology at Deakin University, Australia. 

My research focuses on understanding how species interact with each other and large-scale ecological processes (e.g. fire, weather), and exploring how these can best be managed to benefit biodiversity cost-effectively. I use a combination of quantitative, field-based and structured facilitation approaches to better understand species and ecosystems to help improve conservation outcomes for biodiversity. 

I'm always interested in new projects, so please get in touch at **[wlge[at]deakin.edu.au](mailto:wlge@deakin.edu.au)**

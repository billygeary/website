I am an applied, quantitative ecologist with experience in a broad range of disciplines including ecosystem management, decision science, spatial conservation planning and conservation biology. I have over seven years experience developing biodiversity policy and conducting ecological research. This includes the development and implementation of ecological decision-support tools, providing evidence-based advice for policy development and fit-for-purpose decision analysis for landscape-scale, multi-million dollar biodiversity investment programs and threatened species conservation. 

My research focuses on how species interact with each other and large-scale ecological processes (e.g. fire, weather), and exploring how these can best be managed to benefit biodiversity cost-effectively. I use a combination of quantitative, field-based and structured facilitation approaches to better understand ecosystems and help managers have good outcomes for biodiversity. 

I am currently working on my PhD at the Centre for Integrative Ecology at Deakin University, Australia.

I am an applied, quantitative ecologist with experience in a broad range of disciplines including ecosystem management, decision science, spatial conservation planning and conservation biology. I am currenly a PhD Student in the Centre for Integrative Ecology at Deakin University, Australia. 

My research focuses on how species interact with each other and large-scale ecological processes (e.g. fire, weather), and exploring how these can best be managed to benefit biodiversity cost-effectively. I use a combination of quantitative, field-based and structuredfacilitation approaches to better understand ecosystems and help managers have good outcomes for biodiversity.
